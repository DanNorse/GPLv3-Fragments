# GPLv3-Fragments
**Coffee to Code and All That.**

Various snippets of code from my private repositories.
There is no specific goal of this repository except as a place to showcase code that others may have a use for.
The vast majority of files you'll find will be designed for use with Unity.

**These files have been mercilessly gutted** in order to keep them useful and to-the-point (As well as avoiding legal ass-biting from collaboration projects). For this reason, DO NOT EXPECT THEM TO BUILD. They're basically just algorithm mockups.

I might consider adding a public commit branch when there's a few more files here.
